# Hotel Review Star Classifier Web App

This Flask web application allows users to input a hotel review and receive a star prediction (1 - 5) using a pre-trained One vs Rest multiclass classification model. Users can select between Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes or Random Forest to be used as the binary algorithm within the classifier. The models have been saved in `.pkl` files for ease of use.
